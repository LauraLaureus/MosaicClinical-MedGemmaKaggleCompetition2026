Internal Medicine Report  
*Reason for consultation: Referral from primary care due to poorly controlled hypertension.  
*Family history: Father deceased at 76 years old from acute myocardial infarction; mother deceased with recurrent stroke during life. Maternal uncle died at age 30, cause unknown.  
*Toxic habits:  
- Smoker 25 cigarettes/day since age 19  
- Occasional alcohol consumption  
- No other drugs

Medical history:
- Hypertension diagnosed in 2001; irregular control since onset; on Enalapril 10 mg / Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, Amlodipine 5 mg, Doxazosin 4 mg.
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 2010; no target‑organ damage; not insulin‑dependent; on Metformin 850 mg / Dapagliflozin 25 mg.
- Mixed dyslipidemia since youth (possible familial); previously on rosuvastatin, discontinued due to myalgias; from 2011 on ezetimibe 10 mg; still elevated levels. Latest labs: total cholesterol 367 mg/dL, triglycerides 400 mg/dL.
- Rheumatoid arthritis under rheumatology follow‑up; takes Methotrexate 10 mg Tuesdays, folic acid Thursdays; had been on prednisone 5 mg daily for years, discontinued in 2010 after diabetes diagnosis.
- Pulmonary admission April 2020 for bilateral COVID‑19 pneumonia requiring non‑invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Post‑discharge mild exertional dyspnea.
- Mild renal disease (GFR 65 mL/min/1.73 m²), etiology unknown.
- Oligosymptomatic diverticulosis diagnosed after colonoscopy for positive occult fecal blood.

Surgical history:  
- Right inguinal hernia repair, 1999  
- Caesarean section, 1992  
- Tibial fracture after motor‑vehicle accident repaired with osteosynthesis

History:
-64‑year‑old female referred from primary care for difficult blood pressure control despite four antihypertensives.
-Patient reports being asymptomatic. Occasionally experiences holocranial headache; during those episodes BP reads 190/96 mmHg, so she takes rescue Captopril 25 mg at home. Two occasions required presentation to the hospital emergency department because this measure was insufficient.
-Denies orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Mild exertional dyspnea on moderate‑to‑severe activity that began after admission for COVID‑19.
-Habitual cough, nonproductive. Never evaluated by pulmonology for COPD.
-Habitual snoring; partner reports occasional apneas but no sleep study performed.

Physical examination:
Vital signs: BP 165/89 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, SpO₂ 91% on room air.
Eupneic, normal skin color, euvolemic. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular breath sounds, no adventitious sounds. Abdomen: soft and depressible, no masses or organomegaly; bilateral renal percussion negative. Peripheral pulses present and symmetrical.

Diagnoses:  
Hypertension of difficult control; secondary causes to be excluded.  
Probable familial hypercholesterolemia.  
High tobacco consumption.  
Possible multifactorial renal disease.

Therapeutic plan:
- Recommend cessation of tobacco use.
- Request polysomnography for evaluation of sleep apnea, and refer to Pulmonology for assessment of test results.
- Request laboratory panel including complete lipid profile and renal function estimation.
- Request renal artery Doppler ultrasound.
- Request Holter blood pressure monitoring and ECG.
- Treatment: increase amlodipine to 10 mg q24h; if after 15 days home BP remains similar, add doxazosin 8 mg. Initiate atorvastatin 40 mg/ezetimibe and fenofibrate 10 mg.
- Strict monitoring of blood glucose at home.
- Preferential review in Cardiovascular Risk clinic with results of complementary tests.
