**Clinical Report**

Patient: 17‑year‑old female referred from Neuropediatrics to adult neurology for Dravet syndrome follow‑up.

**Family History**
- Maternal grandfather with senile Alzheimer type dementia (deceased).  
- Paternal aunt diagnosed with breast cancer at age 57.  
- Parents healthy.  
- Three older siblings, all healthy.

**Perinatal History**
- Mother 35 years, father 36 years; non‑consanguineous.  
- Controlled pregnancy with maternal gestational diabetes managed by diet.  
- Eutocic delivery at 36 + 5 weeks.  
- Apgar scores 8/9.  
- Discharged home after 36 hours postpartum due to favorable evolution.

**Early Childhood History**
- Sitting achieved at 6 months.  
- At 8 months presented seizures with generalized tonic‑clonic movements during febrile peak; required admission for evaluation. Subsequent episodes coincided with fever peaks at 10 and 11 months.  
- First generalized tonic‑clonic seizure without trigger at 13 months. Since then, multiple daily involuntary movements predominantly affecting the right hemibody and upper limbs. Occasionally forced ocular‑cephalic deviation during episodes. 2–3 seizures monthly involving loss of consciousness with fall and tonic‑clonic activity.  
- Following febrile seizures, psychomotor delay: independent standing achieved only at 36 months; unstable ambulation until 40 months. Delayed language onset and difficulties manipulating objects.

**Investigations at 13 Months**
- MRI normal.  
- EEG showed diffuse generalized polyspike activity, sometimes correlating clinically with contralateral limb clonic movements.  
- Initiated phenobarbital dose‑adjusted to weight; minimal improvement.

**Laboratory Workup**
- Infectious panel and congenital metabolic screening: mild elevation of creatine kinase and lactate only.  
- Genetic testing revealed heterozygous pathogenic SCN1A mutation consistent with Dravet syndrome.

**Treatment Course**
- Started valproic acid → improved frequency of generalized seizures; phenobarbital gradually tapered.  
- At 2 years admitted to pediatric ICU for laryngeal spasm during Bordetella pertussis respiratory infection requiring ventilatory support. Seizure frequency increased up to 20/day in infectious context; clonazepam initiated and continued post‑discharge.  
- Post‑respiratory episode: frequent bronchial hyperreactivity diagnosed as intrinsic asthma.  
- School age required curricular adaptation and support teacher due to cognitive delay and behavioral issues. Persistent seizures with falls, one resulting in right clavicle fracture.  
- At 5 years, during a gastrointestinal illness limiting oral intake, presented at emergency for 6 hours of brief subintrant seizures without interictal recovery; admitted, received IV therapy, started clonazepam 0.5 mg q8h and levetiracetam 50 mg q12h. Switched to oral with same regimen.  
- Cognitively: never developed purposeful speech; alternative communication methods failed → family opted for home education.  
- Recurrent upper airway infections diagnosed as purulent pharyngitis. Bilateral tonsillectomy performed at age 9 after repeated antibiotic courses.  
- At 10 years, increased seizure frequency with loss of consciousness and falls; clonazepam dose raised to 1 mg q8h, then topiramate 100 mg q12h started. Seizure stabilization led to levetiracetam tapering and discontinuation.  
- At menarche (13 years), new seizure decompensation; cannabidiol initiated weight‑adjusted → controlled fall seizures but induced somnolence; clonazepam reduced to 0.5 mg q12h.  
- At 15 years, admitted for food impaction. Endoscopy revealed eosinophilic esophagitis with secondary stenosis. Started omeprazole 20 mg daily and montelukast. Mild increase in seizure frequency during acute phase; no change to anti‑seizure regimen.

**Follow‑up**
- Completed Neuropediatrics follow‑up at age 15; referred to our service for continued monitoring.
